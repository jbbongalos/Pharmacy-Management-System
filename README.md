# Pharmacy-Management-System

This Pharmacy Management System helps a pharmacy keep track of medicines easily. It can add new medicines, sell medicines to customers, and warning when stocks are low. The system makes managing medicines faster and reduces mistakes. Right now, it only does the main tasks: adding medicines, selling, and showing low-stock alerts. In the future, more features like managing employees, suppliers, and sales reports can be
added.

# Features/Functionality (Implemented):
• Register Medicines: Add new medicines with ID, name, stock quantity, price, and expiry
date.
• Handle Sales Transactions: Sell medicines and update the stock.
• Low-Stock Alerts: Notify when a medicine is running low.


# Planned/ (Not Yet Implemented):
• Manage Suppliers: Add suppliers and track deliveries.
• Customer and Prescription Management: Keep customer info and prescription records.
• Employee Management: Add employees, manage schedules, and track clock in/out.
• Reports: Generate daily or weekly sales and stock reports.


# Scope and Limitation:
This system is made for small or medium pharmacies to manage their medicines
easily. It can register medicines, sell medicines, and show low-stock alerts. The program
is console-based, so it runs in a simple text interface and does not save data permanently.
Other features like employee schedules, supplier tracking, customer prescriptions, and
reports are planned but not yet added. The system only works while it is running and will
lose all data when closed.
